djvu to seadragon / deepzoom / openseadragon convertion utilities

it's a set of scripts in bash, java & php to help with the conversion of djvu 
files to deepzom files.

for it to work you need at least php 5.3 and djvu-libre [3.5.25.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/djvulibre/3.5.25.4-3)

the steps to use are pretty easy. create a jar from the given java file
and put it in the images directory.
cd to images & ./convert.sh
